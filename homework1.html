    <h1 class="h1">What it is like raising a poodle from 8 to 19 weeks up to date</h1>

    <p>For my 21st birthday and Christmas present, I was gifted a <em style="color:chocolate;">chocolate and white standard parti poodle</em>. Her name is <strong>Emi</strong> and she is a <strong>crazy</strong> ball of fur. 
    We brought her home at 8 weeks and I have had the pleasures of raising her and watching her grow.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Emi is registered with the AKC(American Kennel Club), which certifies her being a purebred standard 	poodle.<br/>
    The <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/poodle-standard/">AKC webpage on standard poodles</a> has a great overview of the breed and what to expect when planning to raise one.</p>
    
    <div id="Note" style="border-top: thin solid; border-bottom: thin solid">
    <pre class="note">Note: If planning on buying an AKC registered puppy/dog, please make sure the breeder is ethical and know what they are doing.</pre>

    <h3>Four General Poodle/Puppy Facts that I have Obtained from Raising a Puppy </h3>
    <ol class="poodlelist">
    	<li>Poodles are very high energy and need lots of attention</li>
        <li>Puppies in general nap 3-6 times a day</li>
        <li>Poodles <em>rarely</em> shed and make perfect pets to those with allergies or prefer a non-shedding household</li>
        <li>Poodles are <strong>highly</strong> intelligent</li>
        </ol>
        
    <h3>My Observations of Emi from 8-19 Weeks</h3>
    <ul class="poodlelist">
    	<li>At 8 weeks, Emi is being aware of her surroundings and is still warming up to her new family</li>
        <li>At 9 weeks, Emi has grown at least 3-5 pounds since we first got her and is getting more comfortable</li>
        <li>At 10 weeks, she is showing her true temperament and is starting to show more energy</li>
        <li>11 weeks, she is getting <strong><em>big</em></strong></li>
        <li>12 weeks, still naps a lot but is developing greatly</li>
        <li>13 weeks, she is starting to teeth more</li>
        <li>14 weeks, when will the biting/teething end??</li>
        <li>15 weeks, she has outgrown most of her puppy clothes</li>
        <li>16 weeks, we find that she is allergic to chicken-based food</li>
        <li>17 weeks, we are finding some loose puppy teeth on the floor</li>
        <li>18 weeks, she is starting to develop more and has a sense of dominance</li>
        <li>19 weeks, she is using her bark more</li>
